## Pending questions / Notes
- ‚ùì What is the relationship between gravity and thrust values?
- üí° Maybe this has something to do with the /1000 that we saw in Phaser's code.
- `ParticleEmitterConfig::maxParticles` seems buggy - when setting it to 10, for example. We get an infinite generation sometimes randomly.
- Scenes:
  - Scenes ara managed from the ScenePlugin which is located at `this.scene`  from an scene itself.
  - There is two ways of starting an sceen `start('id', data)` and `run('id', data)`. The first one stops the current scene and the second one doesn't.
  - We need to register scenes in the game configuration (`index.js`). The first one will be automatically executed.

  - Choose physics engine
  - Enable pixel-art mode
  - ...

- [ ] Generate ground randomly
- [ ] Add fire animation (jet/propeller)
  - üí° Use particle emitter with pixel-art particles. Maybe use it also for the fire.
