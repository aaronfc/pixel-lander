## Pending questions
- ‚ùì What is the relationship between gravity and thrust values?
- üí° Maybe this has something to do with the /1000 that we saw in Phaser's code.
- `ParticleEmitterConfig::maxParticles` seems buggy - when setting it to 10, for example. We get an infinite generation sometimes randomly.
